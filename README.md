# Kaggle-project- 
Project for in-class kaggle competition

1) For this assignment I am using python 3.6. This assignment is done in Jupyter Notebook
  To run it simply run each sell in the order it is in the notebook
Requirements:
  Numpy version - '1.15.1'
  Pandas version - '0.23.4'
  torch version - '0.4.1'
  sklearn version - '0.20.0'

2) Note that although it is rare, but during some runs of the pytorch model it can produce negative results. However, I am using ensemble  of different models, and I add the model to the ensemble if it does not have negative values.
